== The toytracks README 

This is the README file for "Toys on Tracks", a Ruby on Rails website
for selling files online. These are the instructions for installing it on a
development machine:

* Install {Ruby}[https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/] and {Rails}[http://rubyonrails.org/];
* Install {PostgreSQL}[https://www.postgresql.org/];
* Install {rbenv}[https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv];
* Install {Git}[https://git-scm.com/]; and,
* Execute the following code at the command line:

    git clone https://github.com/peterkmurphy/toytracks.git
    cd toytracks
    ./prelang-init

For installing to {Heroku}[https://www.heroku.com/], please go to the directory that contains the created Rails app;
it is the one with the Gemfile inside it. Then execute the following code at the command line:

    heroku login
    heroku create
    git push heroku master
    heroku run rake db:migrate


For more instructions, please see 
{Getting Started with Rails 4.x on Heroku}[https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-rails4]

=== Notes

Code for this website was initially generated using {Prelang}[https://prelang.com/aci/12680/generated], and then
modified afterwards to fit the needs of the {design documentation}[https://github.com/peterkmurphy/toytracks/blob/master/design.md]. 
While Prelang has been described as "abandonware", it was easier to use than 
{Rails Composer}[https://github.com/RailsApps/rails-composer], which (as of January 2018) is producing buggy-does-not-start
code, especially when {Devise}[https://github.com/plataformatec/devise] is involved. Version conflicts,
missing variables, you name it: it was all happening!

If you wish you can even see a {presentation}[https://github.com/peterkmurphy/toytracks/blob/master/presentation/toyontracks.pdf].
